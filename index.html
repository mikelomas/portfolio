<p class="bio">Hi, Iâ€™m Mike and I have been using tech all my life. I like to transfer my skills into the workplace
I was offered a place on the CodeNation Coding course by my Work Coach. I believe you are never too old to learn new applications and 
processes. The chance to learn python was compelling and I jumped at the chance to acquire some new knowledge.</p>

<p class="bio">I have found the general environment and easy-going nature of the course very easy to get into the swing of things. The modular 
format of the course frame is great for absorbed the information presented by the trainer. The added benefit of working in small teams 
also adds an extra dynamic as its always fun to use a group process in achieving set goals and deadlines.
