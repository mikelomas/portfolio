        <p><b>1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page. </b></p>
        <p>Using Trello I broke the project into smaller chunks. I created an introduction / landing page with a small bio about myself. Pages 2,3 covered the Assignment outcome text with formatting for headers and paragraphs. The final page consists of contact details should prospective employers and business wish to get in touch.

                The overarching theme of the website was a clean minimalist design using web safe colours and a readable yet modern google font. Using a custom CSS file I was able to keep a site wide theme with little heavy lifting.

        <p><b>1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites </b></p>
        <p>Copyright is the right of someone who creates an original image. As soon as an image is created it has copyright and the person who created it owns the rights to that image. Only the owner has the right to reproduce the work, display the work in public and copy the work or sell copies of the work to other people.

                Trademarks are another legal issue to consider when creating a web site. Using trade name without the consent of the owner can lead to site takedowns. Especially from multinational companies who have dedicated teams constantly checking the internet for infringements
                 
                Fair Use is when you use an image for educational or news reporting purposes or if you have transformed the image or only used part of it. The best practise in this scenario it to ask the owner of the image before you publish or upload any content.

        <p><b>1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using web pages and how we can overcome them 
            </b></p>
        <p>Accessibility involves a wide range of disabilities, including visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, language, learning, and neurological disabilities. By following the guidelines set by the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) You can make your web presence viewable to the vast majority of users.

                <p>Navigation</p>
                
                This is probably the most important accessibility issue and applies to any website. Whether people have a disability or not, if a site has not been properly designed to allow for simple navigation, some of the website’s information will be difficult to access.
                
                <p>Site Structure</p>

                
                Properly structured websites use levels of text that have been logically named to show the relationships between different areas of content. For web users without vision impairment, people can understand site structure and a page’s content naturally and quickly by scanning for titles or headings. For people who cannot rely on vision-dependent cues, pages should be structured to provide similar key information to screen readers.
                
                <p>Text</p>
                
                Many millions of adults have some form of vision impairment, These represent a sizable chunk of web users These include a wide range of vision problems including nearsightedness, color blindness, or complete loss of vision. Developing web pages that allow for flexibility in the way text is displayed provides users with a wide range of simple options that can significantly improve how easy it is to read a site’s text.

        <p><b>1.7 Describe which are the appropriate file types for websites
            </b></p>
        <p>A basic web site design should include the following file types

                <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)</p>HTML is a text-based approach to describing how content contained within an HTML file is structured. This markup tells a web browser how to display text, images and other forms of multimedia on a webpage.
                
                <p>CSS</p>CSS. Stands for "Cascading Style Sheet." Cascading style sheets are used to format the layout of Web pages. They can be used to define text styles, table sizes, and other aspects of Web pages that previously could only be defined in a page's HTML
                
                <p>JavaScript</p>JavaScript is a very powerful client-side scripting language. JavaScript is used mainly for enhancing the interaction of a user with the webpage. In other words, you can make your webpage more lively and interactive, with the help of JavaScript. JavaScript is also being used widely in game development and Mobile application development.
                
                <p>Image File Types</p>
                
                The 3 primary image formats used on the web: JPEG vs PNG vs GIF. As we mentioned earlier, there are some image formats that are used much more commonly online than others.
