    <p><b>1.0 - Start by writing an ‘about me’ section about your background, 
        why you decided to come to Code Nation and about your experience so far</b></p>
        <p>Hi, I’m Mike and I have been using tech all my life. I like to transfer my skills into the workplace
                I was offered a place on the CodeNation Coding course by my Work Coach. I believe you are never too old to learn new applications and 
                processes. The chance to learn python was compelling and I jumped at the chance to acquire some new knowledge.</p>
                
                <p>I have found the general environment and easy-going nature of the course very easy to get into the swing of things. The modular 
                format of the course frame is great for absorbed the information presented by the trainer. The added benefit of working in small teams 
                also adds an extra dynamic as its always fun to use a group process in achieving set goals and deadlines.
                </p>

<p><b>1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills? 
</b></p>
<p>For digital projects to be successful, planning has to be the key element. Careful scripting and a methodical approach will pay back in spades. Using tools like trello, slack and google doc help in the collaborative effort. These are wonderful aids and can be linked to easily move data from one application to another.

    From a skills perspective, an engaged and dedicated workforce is vital. A good group dynamic will make any complex project so much easier to achieve. A diverse skill set and personality mix always support a successful outcome.
    
    The final component is a good I.T infrastructure in regards to computers and network topology. A professional IT system that is fit for the rigours of today's modern business environment is of paramount importance. Keeping a flexible and open approach to new applications and working practices is essential.

<p><b>1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your Trello board. 
</b></p>
<p>Using the skills I have learnt whilst on the Codenation course. I used google docs to sketch out the starting phase. Once this is complete I will transfer these into trello cards, colour coding these to aid in readability Addition cards can be created as the project progresses.

<p><b>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why?</b></p>
<p>All projects start with good intentions. However, knowing your team capabilities and abilities is imperative. Overextending and under-delivering is a common mistake. Careful planning and working out a good time frame will help in the long run. Breaking up the project into small manageable chunks helps keep a good work cadence and help meets deadlines.

    A good structure of the whole process should be well documented and easy to comprehend. Every company has a unique working environment. But good industry standard working practises should be applied whenever possible
    </p>

<p><b>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job? 
</b></p>
<p>Spending time to research the latest software packages and industry trends will help guide the initial phase of any project or process. A good group consensus from colleges is also a prerequisite. Acquired knowledge may prove a deciding factor in finalizing any framework.

    Good budgeting and sourcing reputable technology company vendors are critical. Buying out of date or overpriced kit may prove to be a costly error. If your project requires creative software then Apple and adobe products might be the right choice if the company finances could afford such technology. If the tasks require only basic IT systems then used parts or short term hire might be a variable solution.
    </p>

<p><b>1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. – How has Trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control 
</b></p>
<p>Trello is a fantastic visual aid to help plan and schedule a project, from the planning stage to the final build or completion. Using the kanban system to maintain order and achieve a methodical workflow gives any project a fighting chance.

    Sharing Google documents helps enormously in coordinating tasks even with groups that are not local to each other. GitHub provides awesome code version with its suite of lightweight tools to enable a smooth build process between partners.
    </p>

<p><b>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects? 
</b></p>
<p>To comply with the GDPR law all personal data has to be vetted before adding to any digital projects. Careful planning and robust secure practises must be followed before any project goes beyond the initial planning stage. In larger companies, a dedicated Data Protection Officer must oversee the entire operation.</p>
