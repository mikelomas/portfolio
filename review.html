            <p class="bioh1">2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello </p>
            
               <p>I am relatively new to using Visual Studio Code. My previously web creation tool was DreamWeaver by Adobe. I Found VSC very user-friendly, especially when its inbuilt line numbering and a host of other quality of life features. Trello was a great help in breaking up the whole project into manageable chunks. I have seen trello used a road map in many early access projects on the internet. I can now see the power of this application during my time on the codenation course. I shall be using it for every future venture that requires careful planning.</p>
               <p class="bioh1">2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello.</p>
            <p>
                Both applications seem the right fit for the task of creating web site sites. Both are user-friendly and fairly lightweight in terms of computer resources. The ability to multitask between the two programs helps greatly in terms of workflow. Add slack and chrome to the mix and you have a very powerful suite of options to aid in a quick development environment.</p>
                <p class="bioh1">2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change? </p>
            <p>I am happy with the final project given the time allocated for the exercise. I am very new to CSS so the learning curve will be a factor to the end result. If I had more time then I could finesse the overall look. The final build is legible but could use a bit more fine-tuning, to improve the whole theme to a more professional level. More research on CSS is required to elevate the basic menu system to something more appropriate.</p>
            <p class="bioh1">2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project</p>
            <p>Researching standards industry would help bring the general site look to a new level. Also checking out best of class web portals such as the BBC web presence for design hints. Then incorporate them into a new CSS file.</p>
            <p class="bioh1">2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose </p>
            <p>  I examined my website's code structure including the HTML and CSS files. I checked with the online documentation for the WCAG 2.0. Web standard to make sure my codebase was industry compliance. This included makes sure that I used web-safe colours and font sizes that would be readable for a wide range of users with differing visual impairments.</p>
            <p class="bioh1"> 3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of
                productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your
                website? How? Could you have done it in teams?
                </p>

        <p>  If this project was a team venture then I would select individual members to areas in which they excel. For example in my previous code nation task, we worked as a team in creating a python based text adventure. Salman’s artistic flair was key in creating a great look for the game. His eye for small details helped give the title a strong cohesive feel. The allocation team of members to a key task would improve the productivity of the whole project </p>
        <p class="bioh1">3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</p>
        <p>Setting up a flexible design template would improve productivity. This would aid future projects as most of the groundwork will already be in place. A suite of appropriate CSS theme file for various solutions from a standard landing page to a full corporate portal.</p>
        <p class="bioh1">3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what
            would you do differently next time? Teamwork? Use of Slack?</p>
        <p>Bringing teammates near and far closer together with communication software. Effective communication is crucial for team productivity. Using Slack is vital if your team is challenged by geography. Cloud-based project or task management software such as Basecamp is great for keeping your team on track and on the right page.</p>
        <p class="bioh1">3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</p>
        <p>Testing digital solutions should be baked in part of the process of any project. Even during the nebulous design phase error checking should be ongoing. Once the team are happy with the final build then a rigorous in house or unit quality assurance pass should take place. If the project is web-based then testing on a wide spectrum of internet browsers such as chrome, firefox, safari and opera should be a prerequisite.
            
            Once the internal testing has been completed then an open beta test to a select number of outside trusted users should be carried out. Feedback taken from open social media channels should be acted on before a final public release date is set or announced.</p><p><br</p>
